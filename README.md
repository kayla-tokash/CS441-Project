1. Define weight parameters
	- Power/Signal Strength
	- Security of node (???)
	- Transfer speed
	- Connections established ( how man people are using that network)
2. Implement Algos; Implementation details:
	- Linux
	- C
	- UMBC GL
	- GitHub
3. Sample data
	- Airodump
	- Explain approach to generating sample data
4. Explain adhoc
	- What is it?
	- Topology
	- Why are these algos. relavant to it?
	- How does are sample data relate to it?


In a situation where there is not an established network infrustructure, such as a disaster zone, we want to provide a reliable, secure, high-speed connection for users by deploying an adhoc network. (explain topology of the network) The adhoc network will act as a mesh of nodes. Each node is a access point to the network. The goal of the algorithms is determine a path connecting the nodes from the user to the internet. The path should provide the highest network speed without comprimising the reliability. The reliability will be determined by signal strength between each node. (How is security weighted? Encryption?)
